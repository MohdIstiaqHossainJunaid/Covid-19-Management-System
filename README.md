# Covid-19-Management-System
 
**This is my CSE311(Database Management System) course project.**  
In this project, there are three portals Doctor Portal, Nurse Portal, and Admin Portal. In the Doctor portal, he/she can update the information of the patient and he/she can see the pie chart of the percentage of Prescribed patients. In the Nurse portal, she will give or add all the important information of the patient and she can also see the whole situation by the pie chart of Covid patient. In the Admin portal, he/she has the power to delete the information. Basically, we try to apply All the basic information of the database management system.
